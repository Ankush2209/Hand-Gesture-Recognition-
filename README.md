I have developed a **Hand Gesture Recognition System**  using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to control a drone with six different classes of gestures namely UP, DOWN, BACKWARD, FORWARD, RIGHT & LEFT .

I have implemented **Real time video processing** to detect and classify gestures translating them into drone commands for directional movements.
I have also ensured High accuracy and have been constantly trying to improve my model in terms of accuracy and responsiveness.

I have also added a screen recording video which explains my project :)
